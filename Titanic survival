#QUESTION 3

#Divide the provided Titanic Survival Data into two subsets: a training data set and a test data set. Use whatever strategy you believe it best. Justify your answer.

# load the dataset
titanic <- read.csv('titanic_data.csv', header = TRUE, na.strings = c(''))

# structure of the dataset
str(titanic)

# checking for missing values
summary(titanic)

# age has 177 missing values, cabin 687 and embarked 2
# since cabin has many missing values that will potentially many different
# levels, leaving it out from further analysis

# handling missing embarked values
# filtering the rows with missing embark values
filter(titanic, is.na(Embarked))

# the two passengeres paid 80 bucks as the ticket fare, so the port of embarkation
# with a similar ticket price is likely to be the one for both the passengrs given
# thier passenger class
embark_fare <- titanic %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Embarked))

ggplot(embark_fare, aes(Embarked, Fare, fill = factor(Pclass))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 80)

# imputing the missing embark values
# it is clear that both the passengers most likely boarded from 'C' as the intercept
# 80 corresponds to Pclass 1 for 'C'
titanic$Embarked[is.na(titanic$Embarked)] <- 'C'

# handling the missing age values
age_non_missing <- titanic %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Age))
age_missing <- titanic %>% 
  filter(is.na(Age))

# creating a regression tree model to predict age
age <- rpart(Age ~ factor(Pclass) + Sex + Fare + Embarked, age_non_missing)

# predicting the age 
age_predict <- round(predict(age, age_missing))

# imputing the missing age values
titanic$Age[is.na(titanic$Age)] <- age_predict

# to build a robust model, that can be trained and achieve high accuracy when 
# predicting the values of unseen data

#Construct a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a passenger surviving the Titanic accident. Test the statistical significance of all parameters and eliminate those that have a p-value > 0.05 using stepwise backward elimination.

# only features with p < 0.05 are left, these are Pclass, Sex, Age, Sibsp

# stepwise backward elimination of the features from the initial model using 
# AIC as the determining criteria
